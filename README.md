# alert-dialog-box
I faced a small error here, if any of you can help me, it'll be wonderful. 
I can't seem to save the language chosen when I exit the app, I used .apply in sharedPreferences putString but it didn't work as it was in Rob Percival's video no. 111 in the android oreo developer course
